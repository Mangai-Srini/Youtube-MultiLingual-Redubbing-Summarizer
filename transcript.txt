 Internet per itami sari dsr playlist Type the day sare 3 resources Ravar on sabhi free resources per Millions my views Oskhe baad bhi Har ko i ek aki job in main hi le pata Job to chhodo Agar man ko ik nea lead core ka question de te Ono to bhi wo ska logic ko chse nai hi sorg paate Last video me manage up tum lobo ko best free resources batayat Tum lobo ne dhe zare comments kare Ki please how to utilize these resources in the most efficient way Is par ek video banau And this is the video on how you can use best free resources on the internet in the best and the most efficient way And tum ek kis tara ideali us ko use kkar na chaiye Ge gai dhe aur ge video ko dhe khe baad Tum haris in the game je tani bhi logic build up silator problem sai Jitani bhi ashi problem sai ki tum video to dhe khe baad Kut se court ne hi carve paate Ah fird video dhey khe baad Tum al ghez ko startup ko Ta o ia videod buhari in sabhi problem koilledì§€ sunny Round YaSeemba baat tumbhu lu Send O U Ford You don't have to do this You have to open a playlist and not watch his video You are not watching Netflix series You are watching a video Stop You have come to read a topic and you have to open the questions It is very important It is like no one is in the playlist You have to start like this It is very important that you understand the basics first The basics All the algorithms These are two things You want to understand The most important algorithms of that topic is to make their list This is the best way to make this list You search on Google Graph algorithm list You will get a lot of articles which will tell different types of lists because of the graph algorithms If you are not able to find articles on Google You can use any sheet I have already told you the best results I will link the video on the i button You will definitely watch the video after watching this video But use the sheet and the more algorithms are written in the sheet Use the algorithms Remember the sheet I tell you is a topic-wise sorted You can easily see which one is the best which one is the best which one is the best So first of all, the best is to keep the list in a lot of ways Now let's talk about the best algorithms Mind you I have not come on YouTube I have not come on YouTube's playlist When you have come to understand the basics then first of all, read articles on Google I will tell you a simple psychology which I have used in my life and which works very well for me If I read something If I read something The process of reading something makes me more involved in understanding that topic Rather than watching a video which I am explaining and I am just listening to it When I am reading something then I am more involved in reading things So that I understand quickly or I think my own effort is more than understanding it And this is what I observed in myself That's why I always read articles on Google and make sure I read them properly Because when I read it I am more involved in reading If I don't understand it then I go to GPT and I say GPT because I did not understand this four logic in this particular text Can you elaborate? And the best part is that GPT is very good at elaborating And that's why when I was reading I didn't use GPT I didn't use this thing But you are reading and GPT So please use GPT for understanding You can do the same thing with the code of understanding If you don't understand the basic algorithms code After all the effort If you think that you don't understand the same thing Or you want to understand it better Now go to a YouTube playlist and start watching the basics of algorithms in it This is when you actually go towards a video You don't have to start from a video guys Come on Watch a video It's a later stage You guys start watching the first video There is a Netflix documentary There is a movie And then you say that we forgot Of course you forgot This is a very obvious thing If you look at it like a movie Now if you are watching this video Then you will forget all these points If you are not writing notes that you are going to forget the point number 1 Then you will forget The basic algorithms When you learn from the money Now it is time to practice the questions of the only algorithms Again, you are also picking questions from somewhere If you are picking a sheet from the question Don't go to its video directly No Video is the last step If you are not understanding it from somewhere Then go and watch the video Or maybe I am missing something Which I can't think of Or I can't understand what is written What will you do To solve that question You will have to take time 30 minutes is I think a sweet spot 30 minutes is the question To think of two things If you are not coming after 30 minutes Then you can go and look at the solution But 30 minutes To decode that question To understand that question And how do you understand the question How do you break down the question If you want to make a detailed video Then tell us in the comment section This will also come Decode the question from the Dung And try to think of its solution And how to think of it from yourself Again, you have already learnt the dual-gord And will be the same changes Now from the Dung You understood a partial solution Or no solution is understood In both the cases You will not go to the video You will see a solution You will see a code And try to understand it And let me tell you To understand this code How does that code work From yourself That is also a very important exercise That is needed for every code around there And I do not know if it is not addressing or underestimated To understand the code One thing is that you exercise very well So you have to decode that code Do not look at the video And to understand the code How does that code work After doing a dry run You did not understand the code So if you ask the GPT I do not understand any line Please tell me how this line works GPT can also be shown by drying the code You can also call GPT You can show me dry run But if you do not understand Then go and watch that video Click on its playlist Before that you do not click on the playlist You will have to solve this much You have to solve a question in the beginning If you do this much in 10 questions I promise you that You will have to solve this question So I will have to solve the question And that is my promise But for the next 10 questions You should be ready And this is the correct way to utilize any resource Any video Be it DSA Be it development If you are building new things You are working new things And you are watching another video So you are watching zero by zero You are absolutely zero But you are not doing this Now let's talk about You have opened that video And now you are watching this video Now when you are watching this video You are very important that you are not doing this Very important I do not know why people say that Don't make notes Basically, you need to have notes of algorithms How will you do it? You want notes for revision Now you want to make notes on paper You want to make a digital platform But you need notes to revise So make notes Very important So you want to know the points What were you forgetting How the algorithm applied Where you thought wrong You have to catch this How the video was thought in different ways And how you were thinking And where you thought wrong in the way you thought You have to write this thing in your notebook So that you don't repeat your mistake If you are doing the same question Then you will know that I will think like this I am the question of this type And that's how you watch a video If you have a video in a video in your notes So again comment And I will make you sure How to make your notes for revision in coding And please remember That you will never remember Which you are reading And you are not doing revision So revision is the key And to revise Very good way And one of the simplest way Is that you join our code as community Which is a free community Which has link in the comments And in this community We study the pair Where two people And then we take the next question And we take the mock interviews And link in the post And we post the entire journey And I am in the comments For free there So you guys can enroll in that community as well Now you have already found out How you can use your resources best But if you don't know How you can crack a technical interview So this video was not a point I have made a video in detail How you can crack a technical interview Without fail How you can crack a technical interview You shouldn't miss that video I will link this video And I will meet you in that video Bye
