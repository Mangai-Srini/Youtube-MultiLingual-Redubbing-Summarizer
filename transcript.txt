is also a very important exercise that is needed for every code around there And I don't know if it is underestimated COD co-summajna, one of the things that you have to exercise very well So you have to decode that code Neither do you have to watch a video And you can understand that code is very good Let's say after driving You can't understand the code So go and ask GPD To say that I don't understand this line Please tell me how this line works Or you can also show GPD to dryrun and do it So you can also say GPD You can show me dryrun and do it But if you don't understand it Then go and watch that video Click on that playlist And before that you don't click on the playlist You will have to solve so many problems in the beginning If you do so many problems in 10 questions So I promise you that you will have to solve all these problems So I will have to solve all these problems And that is my promise But to do so many problems in 10 questions Get ready And this is the correct way to utilize any resource Any video Be it DS, be it development If you are not building yourself in the 2.0 You are not building yourself in the 2.0 And you are watching another video So you are 0 in the 2.0 You are absolutely 0 in the 2.0 Now let's talk about that you have opened that video And now you are watching this video Now when you are watching this video So it is very important that you are not building yourself in the 2.0 It is very important And I don't know why people say that they are building the nodes Basically, if you want to build the nodes of the Galdems How will you do it? You want the nodes for revision Now you want to build them on paper You want to build them on a digital platform But you need nodes to devise So make nodes Very important So you should have written points What were you forgetting? How did you apply the algorithm? Where did you think of the mistake? You have to catch this How did you think of the different ways in that video? And how did you think? And where did you think of the mistake? You have to write this in your notebook So that you don't repeat your mistake again If you are doing the same question again Then you will know that I will think of this question And that's how you watch a video If you want to make a video in a video in a video in a detail Then comment again And I will make you sure How to make your nodes for revision in coding And please remember That you will never remember what you are reading And you are not reviewing So revision is the key And to revise it is a very good way And one of the simplest way Is that you join our Coders community Which is a free community Which is a link in the comments And in this community we study Where two people You have to understand the other questions And take mock interviews And in Lingden we post our entire journey And I am in tour Everybody For free there So you guys can enroll in that community as well Now you have found out How you can use your resources the best way But if you don't know How to crack a technical interview So this was not a point to watch this whole video I have made a video in detail How to crack a technical interview without fail How to crack a very good way You shouldn't miss that video I will link this video here And I will meet you in that video Bye
